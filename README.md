# THE - Tower Puzzle Game that Keeps Appearing in the Ads Except this Time it's a Real Deal (perhaps) || Grow-Tower
 An actual game of the mobile game ads and open-source? Ain't no way!

## Made Open Source so that Everyone can Change It Whatever They Wanted!
I made this snack game a year ago within three days in a small jam with friends. The idea was already planned [way before the jam](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s575/sh/3589468b-a280-a67a-0e32-400673655de8/0c2c5acaab1fc48d85852bf59b366d3e) because of the obvious reason, irritated over the annoying mobile game ads.

I'm not saying the advertised game is bad, nor the method of the advertising is wrong since it seemed to be proven effective after all. But I'm sure there is at least someone like me that want to try the similar puzzle games.

You might already played the games and looked into the devlog. If you haven't, however, you could [try the game first!](https://aomikki.itch.io/grow-tower) It won't bite. Some of you might ask, "why so short?" or "why so easy?" Well... Designing puzzle turned out to be one of the hardest part of the development. It took me roughly one and a half days to make up the basic mechanism that I wanted and an overextended of two days to make all 20 levels.

I decided to keep this as a learning process of game development, if you have read [the idea notes before,](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s575/sh/3589468b-a280-a67a-0e32-400673655de8/0c2c5acaab1fc48d85852bf59b366d3e) you could expand the game accordingly or with your own! I'm not going to limit you but ***just remember to credit me if you use this project as the base...*** Or you could also pull it back to me and I will update it with you in the credits!

### List of Things (and Ideas) that could be Improved from this Project
1. Visual Design
   - Player/Enemy Design
     - Animation
   - Tower Design
   - Background Design
   - UI Design
2. Gameplay
   - Items that affect power
   - Buff/Debuff that could be applied to player/enemy
   - Anything else that you can think of with the game.
3. Level Editor
   
   This one was in the back of my mind where instead of developers like you and me designed the level, why not let players designed their own too? Unfortunately, this is beyond my grasp so I'm going to put this as a heads up.
   
## Afterword
Thank you for your time and visit!
